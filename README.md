# bootstrap-react-redux-webpack-ssr-seven

## Overview:

App is a continuation of repo `bootstrap-react-redux-webpack-ssr-six`. Picks up at last push `refactor-scss-dir-structure-modified-app-scss-directory-structure-and-games-tictactoe-directory` of `bootstrap-react-redux-webpack-ssr-six`.

(made several changes to `bootstrap-react-redux-webpack-ssr-six` and simply decided to revert back to last push (Git))

Initial push of this app is `refactor(dev config devtool): using devtool inline-source-map for client and source-map for server`. Not seeing `Errors` / `Warnings` so far (will change) with webpack HMR or with `sourceMap`.
